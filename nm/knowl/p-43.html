<p>Mathematically, \(x\) could be found as \(x = A^{-1}b\) where \(A^{-1}\) is the inverse matrix. However, this is not a computationally efficient way to solve a linear system. Matlab does not actually compute the inverse matrix when solving a linear system. It chooses one of several algorithms based on the nature of the matrix; usually it is a form of “LU factorization” which is discussed in MAT 532. But even though the formula \(x = A^{-1}b\) is not actually used, it suggests the notation used by Matlab. For two numbers \(a, b\) we can write \(ba^{-1}\) as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">b/a</code>, meaning \(b\) divided by \(a\text{.}\) If the order of multiplication was important (as it is for matrices), then perhaps \(a^{-1}b\) could be written as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">a\b</code>, meaning \(b\) divided by \(a\) <em class="emphasis">from the left</em>. We do not actually “divide a vector by a matrix” but the notation <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">A\b</code> can remind us of \(A^{-1}b\text{.}\)</p>
